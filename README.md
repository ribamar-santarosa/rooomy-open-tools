# roOomy-open-tools

Welcome to the roOomy's public repository!

[roOomy](https://rooomy.com/) is an [app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rooomy/id569414637?mt=8) enabling augmented and virtual reality for staging for interior designs

In this repository we are experimenting with the publication of some elements that can be useful for other developers.

Each directory contains an independent sub project, since they are all small, at least for now.
